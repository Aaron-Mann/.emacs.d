A Simple, Fully Featured, and EVIL (Extensible VI Layer) Emacs Config. Inspired by what Doom Emacs got right, what Spacemacs got wrong, and with some new ideas and features that strive to make your life easier.

# Prerequisites

#### Git 2.23+
Ubuntu: `sudo apt install git`

Arch: `sudo pacman -S git`

#### Emacs 26.3 (although 27.2 is recommended)
Ubuntu: `sudo apt install emacs`

Arch: `sudo pacman -S emacs`

# Install

Navigate to your home directory, and issue the following command:
`git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Aaron-Mann/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d`

Now go ahead and run emacs! You should see a white screen with ELPA information across the bottom upon your first startup. No need to worry, this is just emacs configuring during its first startup. After processing for ~20 seconds, all packages should be installed and ready to operate. Just one last thing before emacs is ready...

`M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts` (M-x: ALT+x)

Enjoy your emacs experience!
